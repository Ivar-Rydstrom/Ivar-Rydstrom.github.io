Tiim.me is a project website that stores to-do list items in browser cookies and displays them on a simple web interface. It uses proper back-end `GET` and `POST` request handling to  dynamimcally serve templated html content.

The backend runs in [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), one of the popular modern back-end alternatives to [PHP](https://www.php.net/)-based servers, and was originally hosted on a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) daemon. It serves HTML and CSS and JS content generated dynamically based on browser cookie data that is passed during the `GET` request. All browser cookie handling occurs on the front end through Javascript.
