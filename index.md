<hr>

Hi, I'm Ivar. I'm a physics PhD student at [UC Berkeley](https://physics.berkeley.edu/). I also do private physics tutoring with [Cambridge Coaching](https://cambridgecoaching.com/tutors/ivar). Find more information about my tutoring services [here](/tutoring).

Previously, I studied engineering physics, math, and computer science at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/cas/physics/).

I'm currently based in Northern California (East Bay), but I'm originally from Orange County. On the side, I race bikes competitively for [Team Mike's Bikes Development](https://www.teammikesbikes.com/).

## Research Interests

My research in physics falls in the realm of experimental particle astrophysics. In particular, I help to develop powerful low temperature detectors to search for dark matter. I currently work with [Dr. Matt Pyle](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/matt-pyle) at UCB, and I am also a member of the growing TESSERACT collaboration. We solve fundamental problems pertinent to superconducting Transition Edge Sensors, particularly for the application of dark matter detection. Our work benefits the development of various kinds of superconducting devices, from quantum sensors to superconducting qubits for quantum computing.
