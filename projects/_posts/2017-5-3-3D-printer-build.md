## Fused Deposition Modeling

[Fused Deposition Modeling (*FDM*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication), commonly referred to just as ***"3D printing"***, is a manufacturing method that uses a continuous controlled stream of molten plastic to form solid structures modeled in [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design). It is not the only method of 3D printing, but it is the most common, readily available, and affordable technology. Also see [SLA/*"optical resin printing"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography) and [SLS/*"powder bed fusion printing"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering).

## Building a 3D Printer

[Anet](https://anet3d.com/pages/about-anet-printer-supplier) is a Chinese 3D printing supplier company founded in 2015 which sells inexpensive 3D printers and components around the world. Their most popular model, the Anet A8 utilizes an open-source design initially developed by [Prusa Research](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/about-us_77/).

In 2017, I purchased an Anet A8 since I was somewhat interested in 3D printing technology and it was the cheapest option available on the market. At the time, 3D printing technology was just still budding and most 3D printers costed $500-$1,500 on the low end. The Anet A8 was intriguing since it only costed $170.

Unfortunately, since the quality of the components were quite low and the design was extremely barebones, the printer featured numerous design flaws that prevented it from being a useful manufacturing tool without heavy modification. This sparked me to join a community of makers who designed modified components specifically for the Anet A8 with the goal of making it a good 3D printer.

Throughout its service, my Anet A8 burned through 3 main boards, 2 hotbeds, at least one glue stick, more than half a dozen [BuildTak](https://www.buildtak.com/) print surfaces (highly recommended!), and many many extruder tips. What it gave back to me was tinkering and problem solving experience that can not be simulated in any other way.
