## SPLENDOR

The SPLENDOR (***S**earch for **P**articles of **L**ight Dark Matt**e**r with **N**arrow-Gap Semicon**d**uct**or**s*) Collaboration is a small prototype dark matter experiment targeting "light dark matter" in the sub-MeV mass regime.

The two key components of the experiment are the detector, under development by collaborators at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/), and the amplifier, under development at [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/).

The detectors are designer narrow-gap semiconductors. Incident dark matter particles will scatter with the substrate, depositing energy in the lattice and electron structures. If an incident particle transfers great enough energy, it will ionize electrons into the conduction band. Using an external electric field, these conduction electrons will be drifted to a single point contact to be read out as charge signals. With a low-enough ionization barrier and minimized parasitic noise sources, the detectors are expected to achieve sensitivity to particle-like dark matter in the sub-MeV mass regime. [Read more about ionization-type detectors here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_detector).

The charge signals generated by these detectors then need to be amplified before they are read out at room temperature. To do this, SLAC is developing a two-stage amplifier that utilizes [custom low-capacitance High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs)](https://cryohemt.com/index.php/products/) operable well below 4 Kelvin. The amplifier design features a decoupling stage, which disconnects the ultra low capacitance detector from the rest of the readout chain. The amplifier gain occurs on a second stage of the amplifier at a slightly warmer stage of the cryostat. The completed amplifier is projected to achieve a charge sensitivity of O(1e<sup>-</sup>), with overall pre-amplifier gain of roughly 40x.

The SPLENDOR collaboration is currently in the process of publishing several preliminary papers, including one to the [Journal of Low Temperature Physics](https://link.springer.com/journal/10909).

## Room Temperature Filter Box

To bias these transistors, I have been tasked with developing a custom room-temperature filtering solution that operates in-line with the experiment. My "Filter Box" provides passive RC filtering for all transistor bias lines, integrates directly with our custom low-noise power supply, and acts as a breakout for other room-temperature instrumentation.

The current version of Filter Box provides high attenuation to any current-noise fluctuations of our power supply to provide clean DC bias currents to all transistor inputs.
