Hi, I'm Ivar. I'm a senior Engineering Physics student in the Honors College at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/cas/physics/){:target="_blank"}. Aside from phyiscs, I'm also studying Mathematics and Computer Engineering as minors.

I'm also the current president of the [Society of Physics Students](https://www.instagram.com/scu.sps/){:target="_blank"} chapter at SCU. Please reach out if you are interested in joining our community!

My research interests fall in the realm of experimental particle astrophysics: particulary I'm interested in developing low temperature detectors to search for dark matter. I currently work with [Dr. Betty Young](https://www.scu.edu/cas/physics/faculty/betty-a-young/){:target="_blank"} at SCU in her collaboration with [Dr. Noah Kurinsky](https://kipac.stanford.edu/people/noah-kurinsky-0){:target="_blank"} at [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} in the *Dark Matter and Quantum Information Science (DMQIS)* group. We develop novel superconducting quantum sensors for dark matter detection in our lab, *SLAC Millikelvin Facility (SMF)*.

Currently, I am most involved in developing room-temperature electronics for the SPLENDOR project, a prototype dark matter experiment that will use bespoke narrow-gap semiconductors to probe particle-like "light" dark matter of mass in the sub-MeV regime. Our two-stage High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) amplifier is projected to achieve a charge-resolution of O(1e<sup>-</sup>). This project is an exciting collaboration between various institutions that is advancing the bleeding edge of ionization detector and charge-based readout technology.

I'm currently based in Northern California (South Bay), but I'm originally from Orange County. On the side, I race bikes competitively for [Team Mike's Bikes: Development](https://www.teammikesbikes.com/){:target="_blank"}. You can occasionally catch me at Spectrum Ride or the SCU Triathlon Club ride on Saturday mornings!
