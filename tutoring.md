I offer private one-on-one tutoring services for college lower-division physics and high school AP physics courses. I have nearly 500 sessions of experience, and have developed extensive problem solving methods students can use to solve nearly any basic physics problem they may encounter.

If you are interested in tutoring services, please email me directly at: ***irydstrom (at) scu (dot) edu***.
