I offer private one-on-one tutoring services for college lower-division physics and high school AP physics courses. I have nearly 500 sessions of experience, and have developed extensive problem solving methods students can use to solve nearly any basic physics problems they may encounter.

Please email me at ```irydstrom (at) scu (dot) edu``` for inquiries.
